### __presentation__
this is a presentation about myself

With roots in Lund. 
I am a student attending Linneaus university in Kalmar, 
 am studying for a bachelor degree in informatics , interaction design (2019).
 The best thing about interaction design is that it is under developement , you learn new stuff everyday and things you thought was certain change. 
 

 AND then came Javascript...
 I wanted to start 10 years ago but grouppressour led me to digital media and 
 Since I am 10 times wiser now, I jumped for seat in two courser of programming. 
 Fascinated with what you can accomplish with a computer.
